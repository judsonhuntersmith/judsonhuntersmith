			<p>Growing up in a small town in central Maine, called Dover-Foxcroft, I came from a bit of a different
			lifestyle than most of the students here at the University. I grew up on the countryside in a farmhouse 
			where life was simple. My family and I raised Cows, Pigs and Goats for milk and meat for about 15 years. 
			I learned valuable life lessons as a kid having responsibilities taking care of my animals and working hard. 
			Waking up early taught me the values of sleep and helped me make sure I got my homework done at 
			night so I could go to bed early knowing that I would have to be up at the crack of dawn to the mooing cows, 
			oinking pigs and baahing goats. This helped me transition into highschool and college dealing with 
			important time management situations and living life on a schedule.</p>
