			<p>Growing up with a father who owned his own business I decided to go for business 
			administration here at the University Maine. Since I was young I was always conservative
			with my money. I would get birthday money I would keep it under my pillow I wouldn't spend 
			it until I needed something or had to buy  something. Later in high school I began my own 
			business buying and selling Powersports vehicles like four wheelers dirt bikes and snowmobiles. 
			I used craigslist to purchase broken vehicles that I knew how to fix, And purchase a cheap parts 
			online, in order to make a profit. Once I had a taste for making money doing the things I liked
			I was hooked on the business career path and now here I am. Below in purple I have a link to one of my recent
			resoration projects on a 1987 Honda Cbr Motorcycle that I am selling. </p>
