			Hunter Smith: Wide Receiver

			<p> <u>Here is my Bio from the 2016 season:</u> Hunter was a redshirt this year lifting and practicing with the 
			team but didn't dress for games he will have five years total in the football 
			program. Moving on to next season we will be able to use him possibly for special-teams 
			and some of the offenses areas. Hunter is from Dover-Foxcroft Maine where he played 
			Highschool football and was a 4 year player for head coach Danny White's Foxcroft Academy 
			Ponies. He played wide receiver his freshman and sophomore years and was switched to
			Quarterback his junior and senior years. After his senior season was ended from a left hip 
			dislocation and he was back to 100% he played in the Blue-Grey All-American Bowl in Tampa, 
			Florida at Raymond James Stadium home of the Buccaneers NFL Team. Below in purple I have a
			link to my Player Profile on the University of Maine's Football roster webpage. </p>
